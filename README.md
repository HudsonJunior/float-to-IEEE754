# Float to IEEE754 Converter

This project contains an algorithm written in **Python** that converts a floating-point number to its **IEEE754** standard representation, a widely used format for representing real numbers in binary. 

## Features

- **IEEE754 Conversion**: Converts standard floating-point numbers to IEEE754 format.
- **Educational Use**: Demonstrates how floating-point numbers are represented in binary systems.

This project serves as a useful educational tool for understanding IEEE754 representation.
